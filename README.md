## Build and Run

After you fork and clone this repository make sure you run `npm install` to install all the dependencies.

## Project Description

A single page application that uses API.ai as well as the HTML5 Speech Recognition API to allow the user to redirect to other pages by voice command.

The application also uses the Web Speech API to respond back to the user with updates on their request.

## What was the biggest challenge to overcome?

The biggest challenge was communicating with API.ai. I spent four to five hours working with APIAI StreamClient and setting up a test environment. I ended up scraping this because of two reasons: time and lack of documentation. The combination of these two things made me change my direction so I would be able to make the deadline. I ended up going the route of the HTML5 Speech Recognition API because the documentation and support was more pronounced.
